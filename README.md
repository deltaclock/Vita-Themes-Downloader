# Vita-Themes-Downloader
Red Squirrel 's  themes downloader . VSTEMA also added.

This script is clearly for practice.
If someone can improve its effectiveness I'm open for suggestions ;)

# Note
The script will throw an error on the first run cuz the log.txt doesn't exist.
Create one on your working dir if this bothers you.
